>Tears made a sprint to my chest...\\
Bygone days made an appearance in my dreams...\\
It slowly crept into the best of my days...\\
The days which would never make a comeback...\\
It took a while to realise why you had come in my dreams...\\
You made me realise what love is...\\
I had lost it for quite a while...\\
The short strides you took for my sake...\\
The hands those you got wet with my saliva without any hesitation...\\
The arms that always stretched for both happiness and sorrow...\\
Times did change..But never did you...\\
Now I am far away, submerged deep in the making of my life...\\
Tears did make a sprint to my chest which you would never realise...\\
Cos they are in my heart which I dont want you to see in my eyes..

>Love you Mother!!!
